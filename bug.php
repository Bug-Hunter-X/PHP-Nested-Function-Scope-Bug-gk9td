In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with variable scope within nested functions or closures.  Consider this example:

```php
function outerFunction() {
  $outerVar = 'Hello';

  $innerFunction = function() use ($outerVar) {
    echo $outerVar; 
  };

  $innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```

This seems straightforward, but if you unintentionally omit `use ($outerVar)`,  `$outerVar` will not be accessible inside the innerFunction. PHP will not throw an error, it will instead return a notice about undefined variable, or even worse, silently use a different, possibly unintended variable.

Another common example is when dealing with references. Modifying a variable passed by reference within a function might not have the intended effect if the reference is not handled correctly.  Accidental reassignment inside a function can break your references.
